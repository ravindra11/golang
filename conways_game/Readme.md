### Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Dr.Conway, who died, having spent the latter part of his career at Princeton,sometimes called Life a 'no-player, never-ending game'.

The game was simple: Place any configuration of cells on a grid, then watch what transpires according to three rules that dictate how system playes out.

### Rules
##### 1-Birth rule:
An empty, or dead cell with precisely three live meighbours(full cells) becomes live.

##### 2- Death rule:
A live cell with zero or one neighbours dies of isolation; a live cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding.
